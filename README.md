# Non-Propagating Hydrodynamic Solitons

Demonstration and report on non-propagating free-surface solitary waves created in a parametrically driven rectangular channel. 

The channel was filled with water (as the fluid of interest) mixed with a few drops of Kodak PhotoFlo (as a surfactant) and fluorescein dye.

The experiment was built and run within my apartment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was submitted as my final project for the Acoustics Lab (180D) at UCLA.
